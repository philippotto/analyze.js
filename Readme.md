# analyze.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philippotto/analyze.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/philippotto/analyze.js)

analyze.js is a tool to analyze applications which rely on node or JavaScript or any language which compiles to JavaScript.
The dynamic analysis process focuses on protocolling function invocations as well as determining module dependencies and various runtime characteristics.

analyze.js consists of:
- a back-end which proxies a local webapp and instruments requested JavaScript files on the fly
- a front-end which provides an overview of the analyzed characteristics

analyze.js is currently work in progress.
